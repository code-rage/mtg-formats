# Limit Break Magic
Each player has 2 smaller decks and once the first deck runs out of cards they can cast cards from the second deck regardless of mana color.

Only 3 booster packs per player are needed for sealed play.

## Rules
### Deck construction
Each player constructs 2 decks: one *Main Deck* and one *Limit Break Deck*.

The minimum size of these decks is half of the usual minimum, i.e. 20 for sealed play. **The 2 decks must also contain the same number of lands**.

The *Main Deck* is a player’s starting library and should follow the normal guidelines for deck construction.

The *Limit Break Deck* is a whole different beast. Once a player gets access to this deck they will
1) usually already have a decent amount of lands and
2) be able to cast cards regardless of mana color

With this in mind, the *Limit Break Deck* could favorably contain cards of any color and of higher mana costs than those in the *Main Deck*.

### Gameplay
Players start with only their *Main Deck* in the library zone.

If a player’s *Main Deck* runs out of cards, that player reaches the *Limit Break*, which has the following effects:
* The player adds their *Limit Break Deck* to their library.
* Lands under the player’s control are now every basic land type in addition to their other types.
* The player can freely change the color of any mana they produce.

## Features
This format has the following pros:
* Cuts the price tag of sealed decks in half
* Speeds up construction of sealed decks
* Increases the power level of (most) sealed decks
* Uses a much higher percentage of the card pool in sealed decks
* Reduces the chance of starting hands with only high cost cards
